      "I've been fascinated by [[computing]] for as long as I can remember. In the photo on the side, I'm the boy in green, intently watching upperclassmen present their robotics projects. Back then, I was certain I'd become a %%robotics engineer%%. Today, that same curiosity has led me into [[software development]]. While I've traded physical components for lines of code, my %%thirst%% for learning and my fascination with emerging technologies %%remain unchanged%%. I am driven by curiosity and a genuine love for tech. My focus is on contributing to scalable, accessible, and well-architected products, always striving for [[technical excellence]] in everything I create.",

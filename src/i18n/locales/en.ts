    paragraph1:
      "I've been fascinated by [[computing]] for as long as I can remember. In the photo on the side, I'm the boy in green, intently watching upperclassmen present their robotics projects. Back then, I was certain I'd become a %%robotics engineer%%. Today, that same curiosity has led me into [[software development]]. While I've traded physical components for lines of code, my %%thirst%% for learning and my fascination with emerging technologies %%remain unchanged%%. I am driven by curiosity and a genuine love for tech. My focus is on contributing to scalable, accessible, and well-architected products, always striving for [[technical excellence]] in everything I create.",
    paragraph2:
      "Outside the digital world, [[soccer]] is my greatest passion. The photo on the right captures where it all began: a young version of myself supporting my hometown team, %%Esporte Clube Vitória%%. Beyond just being a fan, I play weekly for a local team, which strengthens my sense of [[teamwork and discipline]]. I am also driven by %%creativity%%; whether I’m listening to music or sketching out new ideas, my mind is always searching for the [[next challenge]]. I maintain a consistent list of %%personal projects and technical studies%% that I work on in my spare time, always focused on bringing each of these ideas to life.",
